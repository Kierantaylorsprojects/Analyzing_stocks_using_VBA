# VBA_Project: The VBA of Wall Street

    ## Background
    
        In this project I went through and used VBA scripting to carry out various commands in order to organize my data set accordingly. More spefically we looked at data relating to stock analysis based on their tickers. We organized and dedicated spefic columns to ticker symbols, yearly change from starting price to closing price in a given year , the percent change from opening price to closing price in a given year and the total stock volume fo the stock.
