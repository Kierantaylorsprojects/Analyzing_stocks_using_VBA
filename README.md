# VBA_Project: The VBA of Wall Street

   ## Summary
   
In this project I went through and used VBA scripting to carry out various commands in order to organize my data set accordingly.

More specifically, we performed stock analysis with data based on their tickers.

We organized and dedicated specific columns to ticker symbols, yearly change from starting price to closing price in a given year; the percent change from opening price to closing price in a given year, and the total stock volume of the stock.
